# **Usage**
Just run ``python3 __init__.py`` via ssh on a Raspberry Pi, ensuring the necessary components are connected
# **Components**
SLUG is made to run on a range of components, and I don't have the budget to test for functionality. Most are made to run on PWM, not independent libraries, so by just tweaking values you should get everything working pretty easily.

It requires two well-aligned servos for the front wheels, and a free axle for the rear. The robot should have four wheels, preferrably. The ultrasonic sensor is to be mounted in the snoot of SLUG, as well-centered as possible, too. Mount some wheels on the servo, but don't make them too grippy as it's made to have slippy wheels.
